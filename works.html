        <h3>AR AND VR</h3>
        <p>AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality) are two emerging
          technologies that allow users to experience immersive digital
          environments. Unity and Vuforia software are used in the project.Both AR and VR have the potential to transform industries such as gaming, education, healthcare, and retail by creating new and engaging ways to interact with digital content.</p>

        <h3>MEDICAL BOT USING AI</h3>
        <p>The chat bot will allow users to interact with it for instant medical
          advice accessible to the public with a modern method of
          interaction. AI can diagnose the disease and provide basic details
          about the disease before consulting a doctor.This will help to reduce healthcare costs and improve accessibility to medical knowledge.</p>

        <h3>IOT BASED FOOT PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM USING ML ALGORITHMS</h3>
        <p>This project consist of special sensor based shoe for diabetic patient that 
          collects the flex sensor data and transmit to the server for observation. 
          The collected data is passed to the machine learning based trained model for 
          predicting the foot state. Machine learning algorithms has been implemented to 
          predict the foot pressure state and generate the instruction. We have 
          categorized the states into three states like “normal, moderate and severe”. 
          The collected data is monitored continuously and the states for the foot can 
          be checked in the android based mobile app. .</p>
